## Release v0.4.4

In this update, we've enhanced your chat experience by showing chat buttons only when relevant, making interactions cleaner and more intuitive. Channels now support customizable system prompts, allowing tailored conversations that better fit your needs. We've also improved stability and usability: sidebar menus and buttons work more smoothly across devices, preventing accidental clicks and display issues. For our users engaging with the Zhihu AI channel, message handling and response reliability have been boosted. Additionally, exchange codes now have expiration settings for better management. Behind the scenes, we've streamlined update processes and made the app’s look and feel more consistent with subtle theme improvements. Documentation has been refreshed for clearer guidance, and contributor information is now displayed more neatly. Overall, these enhancements provide a smoother, more personalized, and user-friendly experience.
